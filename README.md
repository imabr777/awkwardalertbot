# AwkwardAlertBot

## Purpose
AwkwardAlertBot was created to help the moderators of the /r/AwkwardSinceBirth subreddit alert its members about a Twitch livestream on the channel AwkwardSinceBirth. It does this by creating a post on the subreddit with a link to the Twitch channel. Once the livestream is done, the post is deleted. This bot was created because it seems that stream alert bots have only been created for Discord and Twitter. Given that most people don't go to Reddit for real-time alerts, it may be fulfilling a need that isn't there, but if it doesn't exist, might as well create it.

## Future Plans
This bot will eventually take over the world. But some more immediate future functionality could be:
* Creating a post for new Youtube videos uploaded on the AwkwardSinceBirth channel
* Generalizing the bot to allow any user or subreddit receive a notification (private messages for users, posts for subreddits) for whatever channel they might be interested in. This may be made as a separate bot
